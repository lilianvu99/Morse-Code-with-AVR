# Morse-Code-with-AVR
Lab 1 was a more complex version of Lab 0. Lab 0 was getting started with the Atmel Studio IDE and the board where the output light on the board would turn on and off infinitely. Lab 1 was to exploit that and make a morse code with the dot, dash, space functions. The morse code had to spell out my first name, last name, and my Red ID number. The dot, dash, and space would stay on based on the milliseconds that are required.  a description of the results, even if it doesn't work, For the lab, I did not have much difficulty with the code but it was tedious to input every letter of the alphabet and number based on the morse code. I also displayed to output pin to PORTB3 instead of PORTB5. Once I fixed the number, the code was able to run. Initially the light would flicker just the letter L infinitely instead of my whole name. It turns out that I did not include the i++ to iterate the next character in my while loop. After I added the i++, my code was running perfectly. It only runs once instead of an infinite loop.
